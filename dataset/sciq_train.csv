Space telescopes avoid such problems completely since they orbit outside the atmosphere. \n Question: Space telescopes avoid such problems completely since they orbit outside the what?",atmosphere,ozone layer,biotic factors,,
"Support: Triglycerides in the diet are digested in the small intestine. Since lipids are not water-soluble, they are emulsified with the help of bile acids, which are produced by the liver and stored in the gall bladder. Bile acids are cholesterol-derived steroids that also contain a water-soluble component. The nonpolar region of these acids can interact with triglycerides, and the water-soluble portion allows the entire complex to dissolve in the aqueous environment within the body. \n Question: Where are bile acids, needed to emulsify lipids, stored in the body?",gallbladder,liver,subducting lithosphere,,
"Support: Gases are also capable of dissolving in liquids. There are many examples of this in our everyday lives. For example, carbonated beverages contain dissolved carbon dioxide.

"Support: After equilibrium has been reached, the concentrations of all reaction components will remain constant unless a change is made to the system. Because the concentrations are no longer changing, it may appear that the reaction has ""stopped. "" This is incorrect; both the forward and reverse reactions are still going on, even at equilibrium. However, because the two reactions are proceeding at the same rate, no net change is observed. \n Question: After what state is reached, the concentrations of all reaction components remain constant unless a change is made to the system?",equilibrium,homeostasis,metal,,
"Support: The esophagus is a long, narrow tube that carries food from the pharynx to the stomach. It has no other purpose. Food moves through the esophagus because of peristalsis. At the lower end of the esophagus, a circular muscle, called a sphincter, controls the opening to the stomach. The sphincter relaxes to let food pass into the stomach. Then the sphincter contracts to prevent food from passing back into the esophagus. \n Question: What is the long, narrow tube that carries food from the pharynx to the stomach by the mechanism of peristalsis?",esophagus,gallbladder,animals,,
"Support: Perhaps the most familiar liquid-solid solution is dental amalgam, used to fill teeth when there is a cavity. Approximately 50% of the amalgam material is liquid mercury to which a powdered alloy of silver, tin and copper is added. Mercury is used because it binds well with the solid metal alloy.

Many of the actinides do not occur in nature but are made in laboratories. \n Question: What do you call the metal elements listed below the periodic table?",transition metals,rare metals,solution,,
"Support: Life on Earth began about 3.5 to 4 billion years ago. The first life forms were single-celled organisms similar to bacteria. The first multicellular organisms did not appear until about 610 million years ago. Many different types of organisms evolved during the next ten million years, in an event called the Cambrian Explosion . This sudden burst of evolution may have been caused by some environmental changes that made the Earth's environment more suitable for a wider variety of life forms. \n Question: What were the first life forms found on earth similar to?",bacteria,mold,sunlight,,
"Support: The mouth also begins the process of mechanical digestion. Sharp teeth in the front of the mouth cut or tear food when you bite into it (see Figure below ). Broad teeth in the back of the mouth grind food when you chew. Food is easier to chew because it is moistened by saliva from the salivary glands. The tongue helps mix the food with saliva and also helps you swallow. After you swallow, the chewed food passes into the pharynx. \n Question: Teeth in the back of the mouth are used for what?",grinding food,swallowing food,centrosomes,,
"Support: RNA consists of just one chain of nucleotides. DNA consists of two chains. Nitrogen bases on the two chains of DNA form hydrogen bonds with each other. Hydrogen bonds are relatively weak bonds that form between a positively charged hydrogen atom in one molecule and a negatively charged atom in another molecule. Hydrogen bonds form only between adenine and thymine, and between guanine and cytosine. These bonds hold the two chains together and give DNA is characteristic double helix, or spiral, shape. \n Question: What has two chains of nucleotides, one more than rna?",dna,gna,beginning,,
"Support: A chain of volcanoes forms as an oceanic plate moves over a hot spot. This is how it happens. A volcano forms over the hotspot. Since the plate is moving, the volcano moves off of the hotspot. When the hotspot erupts again, a new volcano forms over it. This volcano is in line with the first. Over time, there is a line of volcanoes. The youngest is directly above the hot spot. The oldest is the furthest away ( Figure below ). \n Question: Volcano chains form as an oceanic plate moves over what?",hot spot,dust spot,jet streams,,
"Support: Evolution focuses on past life forms and how they turned into present life forms. The history of life on Earth demonstrates how the first cells formed, turned into simple life forms, and then became more complex plants and animals. The studies of Charles Darwin have reshaped and influenced all aspects of biology. The vast amounts of evidence of evolution demonstrates the importance of the theory of evolution by natural selection. But has this process stopped? Of course not. Evolution does continue today. \n Question: What theory of evolution is charles darwin most known for?",natural selection,natural change,cell division,,
"Support: The blood also carries hormones, which are chemical messenger molecules produced by organs of the endocrine system, through your body. Hormones are produced in one area of your body and have an effect on another area. To get to that other area, they must travel through your blood.

Adrenaline has multiple effects on the heart (it quickens the heart rate), on muscles and on the airway. \n Question: What system of the body is responsible for producing hormones?",endocrine system,nervous system,anticodon,,
"Support: Some of the oldest evidence of evolution comes from embryology , the study of how organisms develop. An embryo is an animal or plant in its earliest stages of development. This means looking at a plant or animal before it is born or hatched. Centuries ago, people recognized that the embryos of many different species have similar appearances. The embryos of some species are even difficult to tell apart. Many of these animals do not differ much in appearance until they develop further. \n Question: The study of how organisms develop is known as?",embryology,ethology,adult sacrum,,
"Support: When Earth first formed, it was a fiery hot, barren ball. It had no oceans or atmosphere. Rivers of melted rock flowed over its surface. Gradually, the planet cooled and formed a solid crust. Gases from volcanoes formed an atmosphere, although it contained only a trace of oxygen.

The chromosomes in a pair are known as homologous chromosomes . \n Question: How many chromosomes are in each set?",23,22,polymers,,
"Support: Higher pressures increase the solubility of gases. You are probably familiar with this concept as it relates to carbonated beverages. Before opening the container, the inside is pressurized, so a large amount of CO 2 is dissolved in the liquid. After opening, the pressure decreases (to the ambient pressure), so the solubility of CO 2 drops, causing it to bubble out of solution. Because they are not compressible like gases, solid and liquid solutes do not have noticeable changes in solubility at different external pressures. \n Question: Higher pressures increase the solubility of what?",gases,molecules,zygotes,,
"Support: Tight junctions are composed of strands of transmembrane proteins embedded in the plasma membranes of two adjacent cells. The extracellular domains of these proteins directly join to one another. These joining proteins associate with peripheral membrane proteins located on the intracellular side of plasma membrane.

"Support: Assume that some members of a species become geographically separated from the rest of the species. If they remain separated long enough, they may evolve genetic differences. If the differences prevent them from interbreeding with members of the original species, they have evolved into a new species. Speciation that occurs in this way is called allopatric speciation . An example is described in the Figure below . \n Question: A new species is said to have evolved if separated members of a species evolve genetic differences that prevent what from occurring with the original members??",interbreeding,extinction,biogeochemical,,

The egrets get ready access to food from the relationship, whereas the cattle are not affected. \n Question: What is the term for a symbiotic relationship in which one species benefits while the other species is not affected?",commensalism,parasitism,two,,
"Support: pH Regulation Recall that enzymes lose their three-dimensional conformation and, therefore, their function if the pH is too acidic or basic. This loss of conformation may be a consequence of the breaking of hydrogen bonds. Move the pH away from the optimum for a specific enzyme and you may severely hamper its function throughout the body, including hormone binding, central nervous system signaling, or myocardial contraction. Proper kidney function is essential for pH homeostasis. \n Question: Proper kidney function is essential for homeostasis of what level, which in turn helps ensure the functioning of enzymes?",ph,oxygen,eye,,

Skin color is also a polygenic trait, as are hair and eye color. \n Question: What is the term for traits that show wide variation, such as height, skin color, and eye color?",polygenic traits,maladaptive traits,hemoglobin,,
"Support: At the end of the Cretaceous Period, or 65 million years ago, all dinosaurs (except those which led to birds) went extinct. Some scientists believe a possible cause is a collision between the Earth and a comet or asteroid. The collision could have caused tidal waves, changed the climate, increased atmospheric dust and clouds, and reduced sunlight by 10-20%. A decrease in photosynthesis would have resulted in less plant food, leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs. \n Question: All dinosaurs (except those which led to birds) went extinct at the end of which period?",cretaceous,Tertiary,sliding,,

The tastes are:. \n Question: How many different types of taste neurons does the tongue contain?",five,four,electroscope,,
"Support: Test the hypothesis. Make predictions based on the hypothesis and then determine if they are correct. This may involve carrying out an experiment. An experiment is a controlled scientific test that often takes place in a lab. It investigates the effects of one factor, called the independent variable , on another factor, called the dependent variable . Experimental controls are other factors that might affect the dependent variable.

"Support: Polyprotic Acids and Bases As you learned in Chapter 4 ""Reactions in Aqueous Solution"", polyprotic acids such as H2SO4, H3PO4, and H2CO3 contain more than one ionizable proton, and the protons are lost in a stepwise manner. The fully protonated species is always the strongest acid because it is easier to remove a proton from a neutral molecule than from a negatively charged ion. Thus acid strength decreases with the loss of subsequent protons, and, correspondingly, the pKa increases. Consider H2SO4, for example: Figure 16.5. \n Question: What decreases with the loss of subsequent protons?",acid strength,example strength,epithelial cells,,
"Support: An electroscope is a device used to study charge. When a positively charged object (the rod) nears the upper post, electrons flow to the top of the jar leaving the two gold leaves postivley charged.

"Support: Primates usually rely more on the sense of vision rather than the sense of smell, which is the dominant sense in many other mammals. The importance of vision in primates is reflected by the bony socket that surrounds and protects the primate eye. Primates have widely spaced eyes in the same plane that give them stereoscopic (3-D) vision, needed for judging distances. Some primates, including humans, have also evolved color vision. \n Question: The anatomy of primate eyes shows they tend to rely more on vision than what sense, which is dominant in many other mammals?",smell,taste,protons,,

"Support: As shown in Figure above , each state of matter looks quite different at the molecular level. In the case of liquids and solids, the distances between particles are negligible relative to the size of each particle; they are essentially in direct contact with one another. In liquids, particles are free to move and exchange neighbors, resulting in the properties of a fluid. In solids, they are rigidly fixed in space and held tightly to neighboring particles. \n Question: In what state of matter are particles rigidly fixed in space and held tightly to neighboring particles?",solids,Gases,one,,
"Support: The direction of prevailing winds determines which type of air mass usually moves over an area. For example, a west wind might bring warm moist air from over an ocean.

A bacterial colony often defends from a single organism, producing a colony of genetically identical individuals. \n Question: What refers to a group of individual organisms of the same species that live closely together?",a colony,a enviroment,it is absorbed,,
"Support: As pictured below ( Figure below ), some grazing animals, especially sheep and goats, eat grass right down to the roots. They may even pull the grass entirely out of the ground. Grazing animals can kill the grass. They may thin it out so much that it offers little protection to the soil. If animals are kept in the same place too long, the soil may become completely bare. The bare soil is easily eroded by wind and water. \n Question: By pulling out grass by its roots and over-grazing, livestock contribute to what negative process?",erosion,migration,winter,,
"Support: The trillions of red blood cells in blood plasma carry oxygen. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin , a protein with iron that binds with oxygen. Red blood cells are made in the marrow of long bones, rib bones, the skull, and the vertebrae. These cells survive for about 120 days, and then they are destroyed. Mature red blood cells lack a nucleus and other organelles, allowing for more hemoglobin, and therefore more oxygen to be carried by each cell. \n Question: What is the protein that carries iron that binds with oxygen in red blood cells?",hemoglobin,keratin,ecological pyramids,,
"Support: may be located in organs or tissues that have functions in addition to hormone production. Hormones circulate throughout the body and stimulate a response in cells that have receptors able to bind with them.

Activation energy is illustrated in Figure below . \n Question: What is the amount of energy required to begin a chemical reaction known as?",activation energy,decomposition energy,atomic number,,
"Support: Puberty is the stage of life when a child becomes sexually mature. Puberty lasts from about 12 to 18 years of age in boys and from about 10 to 16 years of age in girls. The age when puberty begins is different from one child to another. Children that begin puberty much earlier or later than their peers may feel self-conscious. They may also worry that something is wrong with them. Usually, an early or late puberty is perfectly normal. \n Question: What is the name of the life stage when a child becomes sexually mature?",puberty,adolescence,ice wedging,,
"Support: Figure 20.33 The outer surface of the heart changes from positive to negative during depolarization. This wave of depolarization is spreading from the top of the heart and is represented by a vector pointing in the direction of the wave. This vector is a voltage (potential difference) vector.

What do you think the relationship is between population density, dispersion and size?. \n Question: What is the term for the spacing of individuals within a population?",dispersion,suspension,brain and spinal cord,,
"Support: The solubility of gases is also affected by pressure. Pressure is the force pushing against a given area. Increasing the pressure on a gas increases its solubility. Did you ever open a can of soda and notice how it fizzes out of the can? Soda contains dissolved carbon dioxide. Opening the can reduces the pressure on the gas in solution, so it is less soluble. As a result, some of the carbon dioxide comes out of solution and rushes into the air. \n Question: Increasing the pressure on a gas has what effect on its solubility?",increase,decrease,opposite,,
"Support: Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals. In fact, mammals are the only animals to have hair.

"Support: The parts of the ears involved in balance are the semicircular canals. These are the curved structures above the cochlea in the inner ear in Figure above . Like the cochlea, the semicircular canals contain liquid and are lined with tiny hair cells. As the head changes position, the liquid moves. This causes the hair cells to bend. The bending of the hair cells triggers nerve impulses that travel to the cerebellum in the brain. The cerebellum uses the information to maintain balance. \n Question: Involved in balance, the semicircular canals are parts of what organs?",ears,eyes,salts,,
"Support: Electrons have virtually no mass, but protons and neutrons have a lot of mass for their size. As a result, the nucleus has virtually all the mass of an atom.

"Support: Genes that are located on the same chromosome are called linked genes . Alleles for these genes tend to segregate together during meiosis, unless they are separated by crossing-over. Crossing-over occurs when two homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material during meiosis I. The closer together two genes are on a chromosome, the less likely their alleles will be separated by crossing-over. At the following link, you can watch an animation showing how genes on the same chromosome may be separated by crossing-over: http://www. biostudio. com/d_%20Meiotic%20Recombination%20Between%20Linked%20Genes. htm . \n Question: Linked genes are located on the same what?",chromosome,genome,pharynx,,
"Support: Nonmetals tend to gain electrons in chemical reactions and have a high attraction for electrons within a compound. The most reactive nonmetals reside in the upper right portion of the periodic table. Since the noble gases are a special group because of their lack of reactivity, the element fluorine is the most reactive nonmetal. It is not found in nature as a free element.

How would you classify your own diet?. \n Question: Mammals are either herbivores, carnivores or what?",omnivores,nematodes,embryology,,
"Support: An underwater earthquake creates a tsunami this way: the movement of the crust displaces water. The displacement forms a set of waves. The waves travel at jet speed through the ocean. Since the waves have low amplitudes and long wavelengths, they are unnoticed in deep water. As the waves reach shore they compress. They are also pushed upward by the shore. For these reasons, tsunamis can grow to enormous wave heights. Tsunami waves can cause tremendous destruction and loss of life. Fortunately, few undersea earthquakes generate tsunamis. \n Question: What type of earthquake creates a tsunami?",underwater,Tectonic,chromosomes,,
"Support: U. S. law states that once mining is complete, the land must be restored to its natural state. This process is called reclamation . A pit may be refilled with dirt. It may be filled with water to create a lake. The pits may be turned into landfills. Underground mines may be sealed off or left open as homes for bats. The land is reshaped.

"Support: Distillation is an effective method to separate mixtures comprised of two or more pure liquids. Distillation is a purification process where the components of a liquid mixture are vaporized and then condensed and isolated. In simple distillation, a mixture is heated and the most volatile component vaporizes at the lowest temperature. The vapor passes through a cooled tube (a condenser), where it condenses back into its liquid state. The condensate that is collected is called distillate. \n Question: What is a purification process where the components of a liquid mixture are vaporized and then condensed and isolated?",distillation,conduction,estrogen,,
"Support: Some mammals are omnivores. Omnivores are heterotrophs that eat a mix of plant and animal foods. Mammals that are omnivores include bears, foxes, rats, pigs, and human beings.

"Support: Mollusks are probably most closely related to organisms in the phylum Annelida , also known as segmented worms. This phylum includes the earthworm and leech. Scientists believe these two groups are related because, when they are in the early stage of development, they look very similar. Mollusks also share features of their organ systems with segmented worms. Unlike segmented worms, however, mollusks do not have body segmentation. The basic mollusk body shape is usually quite different as well. \n Question: Mollusks are probably most closely related to organisms in the phylum annelida , also known as what?",segmented worms,sedimentary worms,the water cycle,,
"Support: Unlike males, females are not influenced by the male sex hormone testosterone during embryonic development. This is because they lack a Y chromosome. As a result, females do not develop male reproductive organs. By the third month of fetal development, most of the internal female organs have formed.

It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it. \n Question: What is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry?","farsightedness, or hyperopia","synthesise , or hyperopia",nylon,,
"Support: Photosynthesis takes place in the organelle of the plant cell known as the chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are one of the main differences between plant and animal cells.

"Support: An inclined plane is also a simple machine. The resistance is the weight of the box resting on the inclined plane. In order to lift this box straight up, the effort force would need to be equal to its weight. However, assuming no friction, less effort (a smaller effort force) is required to slide the box up the incline. We know this intuitively; when movng boxes into a truck or onto a platform, we use angled platforms instead of lifting it straight up. \n Question: An inclined plane is a good example of what kind of machine?",simple,strong,leaves,,
"Support: Epiphytic roots enable a plant to grow on another plant. For example, the epiphytic roots of orchids develop a spongy tissue to absorb moisture.

This form of reproduction is least risky for the mother but most risky for the offspring. \n Question: Female monotremes share what external opening with reptiles and birds?",cloaca,urethra,land,,
"Support: Oil spills are another source of ocean pollution. To get at oil buried beneath the seafloor, oil rigs are built in the oceans. These rigs pump oil from beneath the ocean floor. Huge ocean tankers carry oil around the world. If something goes wrong with a rig on a tanker, millions of barrels of oil may end up in the water. The oil may coat and kill ocean animals. Some of the oil will wash ashore. This oil may destroy coastal wetlands and ruin beaches. \n Question: What source of ocean pollution kills animals by coating them?",oil spill,plants spill,synapse,,
"Support: Photosynthesis begins with the light reactions. It is during these reactions that the energy from sunlight is absorbed by the pigment chlorophyll in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast. The energy is then temporarily transferred to two molecules, ATP and NADPH, which are used in the second stage of photosynthesis. ATP and NADPH are generated by two electron transport chains . During the light reactions, water is used and oxygen is produced. These reactions can only occur during daylight as the process needs sunlight to begin. \n Question: What is produced during the light reactions in photosynthesis?",oxygen,carbon,trans fat,,
"Support: The amniotic sac is a membrane that surrounds the fetus. It is filled with water and dissolved substances, known as amniotic fluid.

"Support: You can see how Mendeleev organized the elements in the Figure below . From left to right across each row, elements are arranged by increasing atomic mass. Mendeleev discovered that if he placed eight elements in each row and then continued on to the next row, the columns of the table would contain elements with similar properties. He called the columns groups . They are sometimes called families, because elements within a group are similar but not identical to one another, like people in a family. \n Question: Mendeleev organized what basic units into rows and columns?",elements,solutions,cones,,
"Support: Lipids play several important roles in the body. Triglycerides are stored in fat cells until the body needs to break them down for chemical energy. These stored triglycerides also help insulate the body against extreme temperatures and cushion organs against physical jostling. Phospholipids and cholesterol are important constituents of the cell membrane. These compounds provide structural integrity to the cell wall, since they are not water-soluble. Other steroids are used as chemical messengers in the body, and the fat-soluble vitamins serve a variety of other functions. \n Question: What play several important roles in the human body?",lipids,cells,constellation,,
"Support: The pyruvate molecules from glycolysis next enter the matrix of a mitochondrion. That's where the second stage of cellular respiration takes place. This stage is called the Krebs cycle . During this stage, two more molecules of ATP are produced. Other energy-storing molecules are also produced (to be used to make more ATP in stage 3). The Krebs cycle requires oxygen. Anything that needs oxygen is described as aerobic . The oxygen combines with the carbon from the pyruvate molecules. This forms carbon dioxide, a waste product. \n Question: What is the second stage of cellular respiration?",krebs cycle,beatnik cycle,innate behaviors,,
"Support: Glycolysis is the first stage of cellular respiration. It takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell. The world glycolysis means ""glucose splitting"". That's exactly what happens in this stage. Enzymes split a molecule of glucose into two smaller molecules called pyruvate. This results in a net gain of two molecules of ATP. Other energy-storing molecules are also produced. (Their energy will be used in stage 3 to make more ATP. ) Glycolysis does not require oxygen. Anything that doesn't need oxygen is described as anaerobic . \n Question: What is the first stage of cellular respiration?",glycolysis,defacation,luminescence,,
"Support: In the Cell Cycle: Cancer (Advanced) concept, cancer is described as developing due to unregulated cell division. That is, cancer is a disease characterized by a population of cells that grow and divide without respect to normal limits. These cancerous cells invade and destroy adjacent tissues, and they may spread throughout the body. The process by which normal cells are transformed into cancer cells is known as carcinogenesis . This process is also known as oncogenesis or tumorigenesis. Oncogenes are mutated genes involved in the development of cancer. \n Question: Cancer develops when what process is unregulated?",cell division,metabolism,muscle tissue,,
"Support: As mentioned earlier, echinoderms show radial symmetry. Other key echinoderm features include an internal skeleton and spines, as well as a few organs and organ systems. Although echinoderms look like they have a hard exterior, they do not have an external skeleton. Instead, a thin outer skin covers an internal skeleton made of tiny plates and spines. This provides rigid support. Some groups of echinoderms, such as sea urchins ( Figure below ), have spines that protect the organism. Sea cucumbers use these spines to help them move. \n Question: What type of symmetry do echinoderms show?",radial,mirrored,butane,,
"Support: In plants, most chloroplasts are found in the leaves. Therefore, all the raw materials needed for photosynthesis must be present in the leaves. These materials include light, water, and carbon dioxide. The shape of the leaves gives them a lot of surface area to absorb light for photosynthesis. Roots take up water from the soil.

(The oxygen released during photosynthesis also exits the leaves through the stomata. ). \n Question: Where are most chloroplasts found in plants?",leaves,roots,iron,,
"Support: There are times in Earth history when all of the continents come together to form a supercontinent . Supercontinents come together and then break apart. Pangaea was the last supercontinent on Earth, but it was not the first. The supercontinent before Pangaea is called Rodinia. Rodinia contained about 75% of the continental landmass that is present today. The supercontinent came together about 1.1 billion years ago. Rodinia was not the first supercontinent either. Scientists think that three supercontinents came before Rodina, making five so far in Earth history. \n Question: What was the last supercontinent on earth?",pangaea,rodinia,motor cortex,,
"Support: GFCI stands for ground-fault circuit interrupter. GFCI outlets are typically found in bathrooms and kitchens where the use of water poses a risk of shock (because water is a good electric conductor). A GFCI outlet contains a device that monitors the amounts of current leaving and returning to the outlet. If less current is returning than leaving, this means that current is escaping. When this occurs, a tiny circuit breaker in the outlet opens the circuit. The breaker can be reset by pushing a button on the outlet cover. \n Question: Gfci stands for ground-fault circuit what?",interrupter,inspiration,radio,,
"Support: No matter what the cell, all cells come from preexisting cells through the process of cell division. This is one of the core concepts of the Cell Theory. The cell may be the simplest bacterium or a complex muscle, bone, or blood cell. The cell may comprise the whole organism, or be just one cell of trillions.

"Support: The strength of an acid depends on the concentration of hydrogen ions it produces when dissolved in water. A stronger acid produces a greater concentration of ions than a weaker acid. For example, when hydrogen chloride is added to water, all of it breaks down into H + and Cl - ions. Therefore, it is a strong acid. On the other hand, only about 1 percent of acetic acid breaks down into ions, so it is a weak acid. \n Question: The strength of what depends on the concentration of hydrogen ions it produces when dissolved in water?",acid,the solution,plants,,
"Support: Summary The concentration of a substance is the quantity of solute present in a given quantity of solution. Concentrations are usually expressed as molarity, the number of moles of solute in 1 L of solution.

Which, if any of them, have to be learned?. \n Question: What is the term for any way that an animal interacts with other animals or the environment?",animal behavior,animal biology,metallic bonds,,
"Support: Diseases of the endocrine system are fairly common. An endocrine disease usually involves the secretion of too much or not enough hormone by an endocrine gland. This may happen because the gland develops an abnormal lump of cells called a tumor. For example, a tumor of the pituitary gland can cause secretion of too much growth hormone. If this occurs in a child, it may result in very rapid growth and unusual tallness by adulthood. This is called gigantism. \n Question: An endocrine disease usually involves the secretion of too much or not enough hormone by which gland?",endocrine,Pituitary,interspecific,,

Long-term storage of organic carbon occurs when matter from living organisms is buried deep underground and becomes fossilized. Volcanic activity and, more recently, human emissions bring this stored carbon back into the carbon cycle. (credit: modification of work by John M. Evans and Howard Perlman, USGS). \n Question: Long-term storage of what element occurs when matter from living organisms is buried deep underground and becomes fossilized?",carbon,oxygen,methane,,
"Support: You consist of a great many cells, but like all other organisms, you started life as a single cell. How did you develop from a single cell into an organism with trillions of cells? The answer is cell division. After cells grow to their maximum size, they divide into two new cells. These new cells are small at first, but they grow quickly and eventually divide and produce more new cells. This process keeps repeating in a continuous cycle. \n Question: What process allows an individual to develop from a single cell into an organism with trillions of cells?",cell division,cell transition,hormones,,
"Support: In addition to holding cells together, tight junctions play a role in the transport of materials. Tight junctions prevent the passage of molecules and ions through the space between cells. So these molecules and ions must actually enter cells (either by diffusion or active transport) in order to proceed through a tissue. This allows tight junctions to indirectly play a role over what substances are allowed into a specific cell. Tight junctions play this role in maintaining the blood-brain barrier. \n Question: What can prevent the passage of molecules and ions between cells, such as in the blood-brain barrier?",tight junctions,fatty junctions,a zygote,,
"Support: Hip Bone The hip bone, or coxal bone, forms the pelvic girdle portion of the pelvis. The paired hip bones are the large, curved bones that form the lateral and anterior aspects of the pelvis. Each adult hip bone is formed by three separate bones that fuse together during the late teenage years. These bony components are the ilium, ischium, and pubis (Figure 8.13). These names are retained and used to define the three regions of the adult hip bone. \n Question: Which bones are the large, curved bones that form the lateral and anterior aspects of the pelvis?",hip,foot,musical instruments,,
"Support: Gravity has traditionally been defined as a force of attraction between things that have mass. According to this conception of gravity, anything that has mass, no matter how small, exerts gravity on other matter. Gravity can act between objects that are not even touching. In fact, gravity can act over very long distances. However, the farther two objects are from each other, the weaker is the force of gravity between them. Less massive objects also have less gravity than more massive objects. \n Question: What is the term for the force of attraction between things that have a mass?",gravity,weight,pollination,,
"Support: Evolution is a change in the characteristics of living things over time. Evolution occurs by a process called natural selection. In natural selection, some living things produce more offspring than others, so they pass more genes to the next generation than others do. Over many generations, this can lead to major changes in the characteristics of living things. Evolution explains how living things are changing today and how modern living things have descended from ancient life forms that no longer exist on Earth. \n Question: The change in the characteristics of living things over time is known as _________",evolution,spontaneous mutation,solid,,
"Support: Seismograms contain a lot of information about an earthquake: its strength, length, and distance. Wave height is used to determine the magnitude of the earthquake. The seismogram shows the different arrival times of the seismic waves ( Figure below ). The first waves are P-waves since they are the fastest. S-waves come in next and are usually larger than P-waves. The surface waves arrive just after the S-waves. If the earthquake has a shallow focus, the surface waves are the largest ones recorded. \n Question: What measurement of the wave is used to determine the magnitude of an earthquake?",height,length,hexoses,,
"Support: Enzymes are involved in most biochemical reactions, and they do their job extremely well. A typical biochemical reaction could take several days to occur without an enzyme. With the proper enzyme, the same reaction can occur in just a split second! Without enzymes to speed up biochemical reactions, most organisms could not survive. The activities of enzymes depend on the temperature, ionic conditions, and the pH of the surroundings. Some enzymes work best at acidic pHs, while others work best in neutral environments. \n Question: Most organisms could not survive without what being present to speed up biochemical reactions?",enzymes,vitamins,hearing protectors,,
"Support: The nuclear envelope is a double membrane of the nucleus that encloses the genetic material. It separates the contents of the nucleus from the cytoplasm. The nuclear envelope is made of two phospholipid bilayers, an inner membrane and an outer membrane. The outer membrane is continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Many tiny holes called nuclear pores are found in the nuclear envelope. These nuclear pores help to regulate the exchange of materials (such as RNA and proteins) between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. \n Question: What is a double membrane of the nucleus that encloses the genetic material?",the nuclear envelope,the complex envelope,cadaverine and putrescine,,
"Support: Vegetable oils are being explored for a variety of uses in which they could replace petroleum products. One such application is in the field of lubricants. Every moving part in machinery (such as engine pistons) needs lubrication to decrease friction and prolong the life of the equipment. Petroleum products serve this purpose now, but are not good for the environment. New techniques for making specialized esters from vegetable oil are being explored that will make the compounds more stable and more useful as lubricants. \n Question: What type of oil is being explored to replace petroleum products in lubricants?",vegetable,essential oil,stratopause,,
"Support: The nuclear envelope is a double membrane of the nucleus that encloses the genetic material. It separates the contents of the nucleus from the cytoplasm. The nuclear envelope is made of two lipid bilayers, an inner membrane and an outer membrane. The outer membrane is continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Many tiny holes called nuclear pores are found in the nuclear envelope. These nuclear pores help to regulate the exchange of materials (such as RNA and proteins) between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. \n Question: What is a double membrane of the nucleus that encloses the genetic material?",nuclear enevelope,cell wall,becomes sodium ion,,
"Support: Another type of skeletal system injury is a sprain. A sprain is a strain or tear in a ligament that has been twisted or stretched too far. Ankle sprains are a common type of sprain. Athletes often strain a ligament in the knee called the ACL. Warming up adequately and stretching before playing sports may reduce the risk of a sprain. Ligament injuries can take a long time to heal. Rest, ice, compression, and elevation of the sprained area may help the healing process. \n Question: A sprain is a strain or tear in what part of the body?",a ligament,stomach,learned behavior,,
"Support: Unlike Archaea and eukaryotes, bacteria have a cell wall made of peptidoglycan, comprised of sugars and amino acids, and many have a polysaccharide capsule (Figure 3.5). The cell wall acts as an extra layer of protection, helps the cell maintain its shape, and prevents dehydration. The capsule enables the cell to attach to surfaces in its environment. Some prokaryotes have flagella, pili, or fimbriae. Flagella are used for locomotion, while most pili are used to exchange genetic material during a type of reproduction called conjugation. \n Question: Unlike archaea and eukaryotes, bacteria have a cell wall made of what?",peptidoglycan,substrates,exoskeletons,,
"Support: Fruit is the preferred food for almost all primates except humans. However, most primate species are omnivorous and consume a variety of plant and animal foods. For example, they may eat leaves, seeds, bird eggs, insects, and other small animals. Chimpanzees may band together and hunt for animals to kill and eat. They may even sharpen sticks and use them as spears when they hunt. Watch this video to see the incredible teamwork of a group of chimpanzees hunting a monkey: https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=A1WBs74W4ik . \n Question: What is the preferred food for almost all primates except for humans?",fruit,grass,8,,
"Support: Fossils are the preserved remains of animals, plants, and other organisms from the distant past. Examples of fossils include bones, teeth, and impressions. By studying fossils, evidence for evolution is revealed. Paleontologists are scientists who study fossils to learn about life in the past. Fossils allow these scientists to determine the features of extinct species. Paleontologists compare the features of species from different periods in history. With this information, they try to understand how species have evolved over millions of years ( Figure below ). \n Question: What are the preserved remains of animals, plants, and other organisms called?",fossils,skulls,asthma,,
"Support: Effect of Temperature on the Solubility of Gases The solubility of gases in liquids decreases with increasing temperature, as shown inFigure 13.10 ""Solubilities of Several Common Gases in Water as a Function of Temperature at Partial Pressure of 1 atm"". Attractive intermolecular interactions in the gas phase are essentially zero for most substances. When a gas dissolves, it does so because its molecules interact with solvent molecules. Because heat is released when these new attractive interactions form, dissolving most gases in liquids is an exothermic. \n Question: How does the solubility of gases in liquids change with increasing temperature?",it decreases,it increases,skin,,
Support: The rate at which a solute dissolves depends upon the size of the solute particles. Dissolving is a surface phenomenon since it depends on solvent molecules colliding with the outer surface of the solute. A given quantity of solute dissolves faster when it is ground into small particles than if it is in the form of a large chunk because more surface area is exposed. The packet of granulated sugar exposes far more surface area to the solvent and dissolves more quickly than the sugar cube. \n Question: The size of the solute particles determines the rate of what?,dissolving,merging,water,,
"Support: In practice, chemical research is often not limited to just one of the five major disciplines. A particular chemist may use biochemistry to isolate a particular chemical found in the human body such as hemoglobin, the oxygen carrying component of red blood cells. He or she may then proceed to analyze the hemoglobin using methods that would pertain to the areas of physical or analytical chemistry. Many chemists specialize in areas that are combinations of the main disciplines, such as bioinorganic chemistry or physical organic chemistry. \n Question: What is the oxygen carrying component of red blood cells called?",hemoglobin,molecule,conservation of energy,,
Support: Delocalization of the electrons makes for a more stable molecule than a similar molecule that does not have delocalized electrons. Benzene is a more stable and less reactive compound than straight-chain hexenes. The sp 2 hybridization of the carbon atoms results in a planar molecule as opposed to the puckered structure of cyclohexane. Benzene rings are common in a great number of natural substances and biomolecules. The figure below shows the structural formulas for vanilla and naphthalene. Naphthalens is a chemical which is commonly used in mothballs. \n Question: Naphthalens is a chemical which is commonly used in what?,mothballs,shampoo,crater lakes,,
"Support: Infectious diseases are diseases that spread from person to person. They are caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses or fungi. What can you do to avoid infectious diseases? Eating right and getting plenty of sleep are a good start. These habits will help keep your immune system healthy. With a healthy immune system, you will be able to fight off many pathogens. The next best way is to avoid pathogens. Though this is difficult, there are steps you can take to limit your exposure to pathogens. \n Question: What system is responsible for defending your body against sickness?",immune system,nervous system,pulsars,,
"Support: All chemical reactions involve energy. Some chemical reactions consume energy, whereas other chemical reactions release energy. Chemical reactions can be either spontaneous, which do not require an input of energy, or non-spontaneous, which does require an input of some type of energy. Energy may be in the form of heat, light or electricity. Each of the energy changes that occur during a reaction are graphed in Figure below . In the reaction on the left, energy is released. In the reaction on the right, energy is consumed. \n Question: What types of energy is released during a chemical reaction?","heat, electricity, light","human, magnetic, electrical",gyroscopes,,
"Support: CHAPTER SUMMARY 35.1 Neurons and Glial Cells The nervous system is made up of neurons and glia. Neurons are specialized cells that are capable of sending electrical as well as chemical signals. Most neurons contain dendrites, which receive these signals, and axons that send signals to other neurons or tissues. There are four main types of neurons: unipolar, bipolar, multipolar, and pseudounipolar neurons. Glia are non-neuronal cells in the nervous system that support neuronal development and signaling. There are several types of glia that serve different functions. \n Question: What anatomical system is made up of neurons and glia?",nervous system,reproductive system,vacuoles,,
"Support: Connective tissue Bone remodeling and repair: bone has mineral structure, and develops tiny fractures, which, under stress, can lead to larger fractures. To combat this, bone is constantly replaced. Osteoclasts channel through existing bone, tear down and leave behind osteoblasts and lacuna, leaving osteocytes. Continually resets mineral structure of bone, and is preventative maintenance. When bone broken, callus forms in open ends, periosteum gives rise to new bone with calcium and new bone matrix, leaves irregular mend. Later, osteoblasts continue fixing over time and slowly removing imperfection. \n Question: Osteoclasts and osteoblasts play key roles in repair of what?",bone,heart,velocity,,
"Support: Reptiles are a class of tetrapod vertebrates that produce amniotic eggs. They include crocodiles, alligators, lizards, snakes, and turtles. The reptile class is one of the largest classes of vertebrates. It consists of all amniotes except birds and mammals. Reptiles have several adaptations for living on dry land that amphibians lack. For example, as shown in Figure below , the skin of most reptiles is covered with scales. The scales, which are made of very tough keratin , protect reptiles from injury and prevent them from losing water. \n Question: What protective substance covers the skin of most reptiles?",scales,hairs,supervolcano eruption,,
"Support: Cells are the building blocks of life. This is clear from the photo in Figure below . It shows stacks upon stacks of cells in an onion plant. Cells are also the basic functional units of living things. They are the smallest units that can carry out the biochemical reactions of life. No matter how different organisms may be from one another, they all consist of cells. Moreover, all cells have the same basic parts and processes. Knowing about cells and how they function is necessary to understanding life itself. \n Question: What are the building blocks of life?",cells,muscles,rh,,
"Support: Reproduction Fungi reproduce sexually and/or asexually. Perfect fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually, while the so-called imperfect fungi reproduce only asexually (by mitosis). In both sexual and asexual reproduction, fungi produce spores that disperse from the parent organism by either floating on the wind or hitching a ride on an animal. Fungal spores are smaller and lighter than plant seeds. The giant puffball mushroom bursts open and releases trillions of spores. The huge number of spores released increases the likelihood of landing in an environment that will support growth (Figure 24.6). \n Question: What do all respiratory diseases affect?",gas exchange process,liquid exchange process,metabolism,,
"Support: Fungus-like protists are molds . They are absorptive feeders on decaying organic matter. They resemble fungi, and they reproduce with spores as fungi do. However, in other ways, they are quite different from fungi and more like other protists. For example, they have cell walls made of cellulose , whereas fungi have cell walls made of chitin. Like other protists, they have complicated life cycles with both asexual and sexual reproduction. They are motile during some stages of their life cycle. Two major types of fungus-like protists are slime molds and water molds. \n Question: What are fungus-like protists?",molds,feces,immune,,
