Hemoglobin also gives the red blood cells their red color. \n Question: What are the flattened, disk-shaped cells in blood that carry oxygen?"
radioactive,"Support: Atoms with unstable nuclei are radioactive. To become more stable, the nuclei undergo radioactive decay. In radioactive decay, the nuclei emit energy and usually particles of matter as well. There are several types of radioactive decay, including alpha, beta, and gamma decay. Energy is emitted in all three types of decay, but only alpha and beta decay also emit particles. \n Question: What are atoms with unstable nuclei are considered to be?"
mitochondria,"Support: Mitochondria, shown here as the green ovals in this animal cell, are membranous organelles which sequence enzyme and electron carrier molecules to make cellular respiration highly efficient.

amniotic,"Support: Another structure that supports the fetus is the amniotic sac. This is a membrane that surrounds and protects the fetus. It contains amniotic fluid, which consists of water and dissolved substances. The fluid allows the fetus to move freely until it grows to fill most of the available space. The fluid also cushions the fetus and helps protect it from injury. \n Question: What type of fluid cushions the fetus and helps protect it from injury?"
camouflage,Support: Both predators and prey have adaptations to predation that evolve through natural selection. Predator adaptations help them capture prey. Prey adaptations help them avoid predators. A common adaptation in both predator and prey is camouflage . Several examples are shown in Figure below . Camouflage in prey helps them hide from predators. Camouflage in predators helps them sneak up on prey. \n Question: What adaptation helps prey hide and predators sneak up on prey?
dna and proteins,"Support: Chromosomes are coiled structures made of DNA and proteins. Chromosomes are the form of the genetic material of a cell during cell division.

Instead, it exists as a grainy material called chromatin . \n Question: What are chromosomes made of?"
cilia,"Support: In the chest, the trachea divides as it enters the lungs to form the right and left bronchi. The bronchi contain cartilage, which prevents them from collapsing. Mucus in the bronchi traps any remaining particles in air. Tiny hairs called cilia line the bronchi and sweep the particles and mucus toward the throat so they can be expelled from the body. \n Question: What are tiny hairs that line the bronchi called?"

Reproduction through. \n Question: What is the process of breaking an individual into parts followed by regeneration called?"
the pistil,"Support: The pistil is the female reproductive structure of a flower. It consists of a stigma, style , and ovary . The stigma is raised and sticky to help it catch pollen. The style supports the stigma and connects it to the ovary, which contains the egg. Petals attract pollinators to the flower. Petals are often brightly colored so pollinators will notice them. \n Question: What is the female reproductive structure of a flower?"
deceleration,"Support: Misconception Alert: Deceleration vs. Negative Acceleration Deceleration always refers to acceleration in the direction opposite to the direction of the velocity. Deceleration always reduces speed. Negative acceleration, however, is acceleration in the negative direction in the chosen coordinate system. Negative acceleration may or may not be deceleration, and deceleration may or may not be considered negative acceleration. For example, consider Figure 2.14. \n Question: What term always refers to acceleration in the direction opposite to the direction of the velocity and always reduces speed, unlike negative acceleration?"
oceanic,"Support: There are two kinds of crust. Oceanic crust is made of basalt lavas that flow onto the seafloor. It is relatively thin, between 5 to 12 kilometers thick (3 - 8 miles). The rocks of the oceanic crust are denser (3.0 g/cm 3 ) than the rocks that make up the continents. Thick layers of mud cover much of the ocean floor. \n Question: What type of crust is made of basalt lavas that flow onto the seafloor?"
alveoli,"Support: The bronchioles lead to the alveoli. Alveoli are the little sacs at the end of the bronchioles ( Figure below ). They look like little bunches of grapes. Oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide in the alveoli. That means oxygen enters the blood, and carbon dioxide moves out of the blood. The gases are exchanged between the blood and alveoli by simple diffusion. \n Question: What are the little sacs at the end of the bronchioles called?"
chemical,"Support: Dynamite is another example of chemical potential energy. The major component of dynamite is nitroglycerin, a very unstable material. By mixing it with diatomaceous earth, the stability is increased and it is less likely to explode if it receives a physical shock. When ignited, the nitroglycerin explodes rapidly, releasing large amounts of nitrogen and other gases along with a massive amount of heat. \n Question: Dynamite is an example of what type of potential energy?"
second,"Support: Enzymes are extremely efficient in speeding up biochemical reactions. They can catalyze up to several million reactions per second. As a result, the difference in rates of biochemical reactions with and without enzymes may be enormous.

natural selection,"Support: Like the animals pictured above, all animals have behaviors that help them achieve these basic ends. Behaviors that help animals reproduce or survive increase their fitness. Animals with greater fitness have a better chance of passing their genes to the next generation. If genes control behaviors that increase fitness, the behaviors become more common in the species. In other words, they evolve by natural selection. \n Question: Animals with better fitness have a better chance of passing their genes onto the next generation, this process is known as?"

The overall chemical equation for photosynthesis is:. \n Question: Most of the energy used by living things comes either directly or indirectly from where?
going dormant,Support: Many plants respond to the days growing shorter in the fall by going dormant. They suspend growth and development in order to survive the extreme coldness and dryness of winter. Part of this response causes the leaves of many trees to change color and then fall off (see Figure below ). Dormancy ensures that plants will grow and produce seeds only when conditions are favorable. \n Question: Many plants respond to the days growing shorter in the fall by doing what?
mass,"Support: Most wave media act like a series of connected oscillators. For instance, a rope can be thought of as a large number of masses (molecules) connected by springs (intermolecular forces). The speed of a wave through connected harmonic oscillators depends on the distance between them, the spring constant, and the mass. In this way, we can model wave media using the principles of simple harmonic motion. \n Question: The speed of a wave through connected harmonic oscillators depends on the distance between them, the spring constant, and the what?"
sex-linked traits,"Support: Traits controlled by genes on the sex chromosomes are called sex-linked traits . One gene on the Y chromosome determines male sex.

A water lily, an oak tree, and a barrel cactus, although different, are all angiosperms. \n Question: What are the most successful phylum of plants?"
airborne mold spores,"Support: Mold allergies are very common. They are caused by airborne mold spores. When the spores enter the respiratory tract, the immune system responds to them as though they were harmful microbes. Symptoms may include sneezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing. The symptoms are likely to be more severe in people with asthma or other respiratory diseases. Long-term exposure to mold spores may also weaken the immune system. \n Question: What is the cause of common mold allergies?"
the walls,"Support: Cardiac muscle is found only in the walls of the heart. When cardiac muscle contracts, the heart beats and pumps blood. Cardiac muscle contains a great many mitochondria, which produce ATP for energy. This helps the heart resist fatigue. Contractions of cardiac muscle are involuntary, like those of smooth muscle. Cardiac muscle, like skeletal muscle, is arranged in bundles, so it appears striated , or striped. \n Question: Cardiac muscle is found only in which part of the heart?"
cytoplasm,"Support: Prokaryotic cells are cells without a nucleus. The DNA in prokaryotic cells is in the cytoplasm rather than enclosed within a nuclear membrane. Prokaryotic cells are found in single-celled organisms, such as bacteria, like the one shown in Figure below . Organisms with prokaryotic cells are called prokaryotes . They were the first type of organisms to evolve and are still the most common organisms today. \n Question: Where is dna located in prokaryotic cells?"
oxygen,"Support: Approximately 20% of the atmosphere is oxygen. This gas is essential for life. In environments where oxygen is in low supply, it can be provided from a tank. Since gases are very compressible, a large amount of oxygen can be stored in a relatively small container. When it is released, the volume expands and the pressure decreases. The gas is then available for breathing under normal pressure. \n Question: Approximately 20% of the atmosphere is made of which element?"
hair,"Support: Hair helps to insulate and protect the body. Head hair is especially important in preventing heat loss from the body. Eyelashes and eyebrows protect the eyes from water, dirt, and other irritants. Hairs in the nose trap dust particles and microorganisms in the air and prevent them from reaching the lungs. Hair also provides sensory input when objects brush against it or it sways in moving air. \n Question: What anatomical structures insulate, protect and provide sensory input?"
expanding universe,"Support: An inflating balloon is not exactly like the expanding Universe. The surface of a balloon has only two dimensions, while space has three dimensions. But it is true that space itself is stretching out between galaxies like the rubber stretches when a balloon is inflated. This stretching of space, which causes the distance between galaxies to increase, is what astronomers mean by the expansion of the Universe. \n Question: What do astronomers term the stretching of space that causes the distance between galaxies to increase?"

For example, jellyfish have tissues that have separate protective, digestive, and sensory functions. Though most animals have many different types of cells, they only have four basic types of tissue: connective, muscle, nervous, and epithelial. \n Question: The four basic types of tissue are epithelial, muscle, connective, and what?"
colony,"Support: Many species of insects have evolved complex social behaviors. They live together in large, organized colonies (see Figure below ). This is true of ants, termites, bees, and wasps. Colonies may include millions of individual insects. Colony members divide up the labor of the colony. Different insects are specialized for different jobs. Some reproduce, while others care for the young. Still others get food or defend the nest. \n Question: Ants, termites, bees, and wasps live in what type of social structure that may include millions of individual insects?"
a viral vector,"Support: Geneticists often use viruses as vectors to introduce genes into cells that they are studying. A viral vector is a tool commonly used by molecular biologists to place genetic material into cells. To be a useful viral vector, the virus is modified so that it will not cause disease, and it will infect only certain types of cells. Phages are often used as vectors to genetically modify bacteria. \n Question: What is the name for a tool commonly used by molecular biologists to place genetic material into cells?"
one,Support: Hydrogen is a good example of isotopes because it has the simplest atoms. Three isotopes of hydrogen are modeled in Figure below . Most hydrogen atoms have just one proton and one electron and lack a neutron. They are just called hydrogen. Some hydrogen atoms have one neutron. These atoms are the isotope named deuterium. Other hydrogen atoms have two neutrons. These atoms are the isotope named tritium. \n Question: Most hydrogen atoms have how many protons?
china,Support: The earliest placental mammals may have evolved about 110 million years ago. The ancestor of placental mammals may be the extinct genus Eomaia . Fossils of Eomaia have been found in what is now China. It was only about 10 centimeters (4 inches) long. It was a tree climber and probably ate insects and worms. Eomaia had several traits of placental mammals. Figure below shows an Eomaia fossil. \n Question: Where fossils of the genus eomaia found?
mitosis,"Support: The first step is mitosis , a multi-phase process in which the nucleus of the cell divides. During mitosis, the nuclear membrane breaks down and later reforms. The chromosomes are also sorted and separated to ensure that each daughter cell receives a diploid number (2 sets) of chromosomes. In humans, that number of chromosomes is 46 (23 pairs). Mitosis is described in greater detail in a subsequent concept. \n Question: What is the term for the multi-phase process in which the nucleus of the cell divides?"
odor receptors,"Support: Odor receptors line the passages of the nose (see Figure below ). They sense chemicals in the air. In fact, odor receptors can sense hundreds of different chemicals. Did you ever notice that food seems to have less taste when you have a stuffy nose? This occurs because the sense of smell contributes to the sense of taste, and a stuffy nose interferes with the ability to smell. \n Question: What lines the passages of the nose and senses chemicals in the air?"
smell,"Support: Vision is just one of several human senses. Other human senses include hearing, touch, taste, and smell. Imagine shopping at the fruit market in Figure below . It would stimulate all of these senses. You would hear the noisy bustle of the market. You could feel the smooth skin of the fruit. If you tried a sample, you could smell the fruity aroma and taste its sweet flavor. \n Question: The five human senses are taste, touch, vision, hearing and one more. what is it?"
north and south,"Support: Earth's axis is an imaginary line passing through the North and South Poles. Earth's rotation is its spins on its axis. Rotation is what a top does around its spindle. As Earth spins on its axis, it also orbits around the Sun. This is called Earth's revolution . These motions lead to the cycles we see. Day and night, seasons, and the tides are caused by Earth's motions. \n Question: Earth's axis is an imaginary line passing through which poles?"
electroluminescence,"Support: A neon light produces visible light by electroluminescence. The bulb is a glass tube that contains the noble gas neon. When electricity passes through the gas, it excites electrons of neon atoms, causing them to give off visible light. Neon produces red light. Other noble gases are also used in lights, and they produce light of different colors. For example, krypton produces violet light, and argon produces blue light. \n Question: How does a neon light produce visible light?"
osmosis,"Support: Figure 3.7 Osmosis Osmosis is the diffusion of water through a semipermeable membrane down its concentration gradient. If a membrane is permeable to water, though not to a solute, water will equalize its own concentration by diffusing to the side of lower water concentration (and thus the side of higher solute concentration). In the beaker on the left, the solution on the right side of the membrane is hypertonic. \n Question: What is the diffusion of water through a semipermeable membrane down its concentration gradient"
seven,"Support: Birds live and breed in most terrestrial habitats on all seven continents. They occupy a wide range of ecological positions. Raptors are carnivores; aquatic birds eat fish or water plants; and perching birds may eat insects, fruit, honey, or nectar. Some birds are pollinators that co-evolved with plants. Human actions have caused the extinction of hundreds of species of birds, and some 1,200 species are threatened with extinction today. \n Question: On how many of the continents do birds live and breed?"
hydrogen,"Support: All biochemical molecules contain hydrogen and oxygen as well as carbon. They may also contain nitrogen, phosphorus, and/or sulfur. Almost all biochemical compounds are polymers. Polymers are large molecules that consist of many smaller, repeating molecules, called monomers. Glucose is a monomer of biochemical compounds called starches. In starches and all other biochemical polymers, monomers are joined together by covalent bonds, in which atoms share pairs of valence electrons. \n Question: All biochemical molecules have oxygen, carbon, and what other element?"
the passenger piegon,"Support: Hundreds of species of birds have gone extinct as a result of human actions. A well-known example is the passenger pigeon. It was once the most common bird in North America, but overhunting and habitat destruction led to its extinction in the 1800s. Habitat destruction and use of the pesticide DDT explain the recent extinction of the dusky seaside sparrow. This native Florida bird was declared extinct in 1990. \n Question: What once most common bird in north america became extinct in the 1800s?"
energy,"Support: A major advantage of aerobic respiration is the amount of energy it releases. Without oxygen, organisms can just split glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. This releases only enough energy to make two ATP molecules. With oxygen, organisms can break down glucose all the way to carbon dioxide. This releases enough energy to produce up to 38 ATP molecules. Thus, aerobic respiration releases much more energy than anaerobic respiration. \n Question: When compared to anaerobic respiration, what does aerobic respiration release more of?"
gas,"Support: Physical properties include the state of matter and its color and odor. For example, oxygen is a colorless, odorless gas. Chlorine is a greenish gas with a strong, sharp odor. Other physical properties include hardness, freezing and boiling points, the ability to dissolve in other substances, and the ability to conduct heat or electricity. These properties are demonstrated in Figure below . Can you think of other physical properties?. \n Question: Oxygen is an element in what form of matter?"
hypha,Support: There are many types of asexual spores. Conidiospores are unicellular or multicellular spores that are released directly from the tip or side of the hypha. Other asexual spores originate in the fragmentation of a hypha to form single cells that are released as spores; some of these have a thick wall surrounding the fragment. Yet others bud off the vegetative parent cell. Sporangiospores are produced in a sporangium (Figure 24.9). \n Question: There are many types of asexual spores. conidiospores are unicellular or multicellular spores that are released directly from the tip or side of this?
slump,"Support: Slump is the sudden movement of large blocks of rock and soil down a slope. You can see how it happens in Figure below . All the material moves together in big chunks. Slump may be caused by a layer of slippery, wet clay underneath the rock and soil on a hillside. Or it may occur when a river undercuts a slope. Slump leaves behind crescent-shaped scars on the hillside. \n Question: What leaves behind crescent-shaped scars on a hillside and  may be caused by a layer of slippery, wet clay underneath the rock and soil on a hillside?"
freshwater biomes,Support: Freshwater biomes have water that contains little or no salt. They include standing and running freshwater biomes. Standing freshwater biomes include ponds and lakes. Lakes are generally bigger and deeper than ponds. Some of the water in lakes is in the aphotic zone where there is too little sunlight for photosynthesis. Plankton and plants (such as the duckweed in Figure below ) are the primary producers in standing freshwater biomes. \n Question: What type of biomes have water containing little or no salt?
heat,"Support: Mammals have several ways of generating and conserving heat, such as a high metabolic rate and hair to trap heat. They also have several ways to stay cool, including sweating or panting. Mammals may be herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores. They have four types of teeth, so they can eat a wide range of foods. Traits of the heart and lungs keep the cells of mammals well supplied with oxygen and nutrients. \n Question: A high metabolic rate and hair are ways mammals generate and conserve what?"
bases,"Support: A: A property that is shared by bases and acids is the ability to conduct electricity when dissolved in water. Some ways bases and acids are different is that acids taste sour whereas bases taste bitter. Also, acids but not bases react with metals. For other differences between bases and acids, as well as why they differ in these ways, read the short article at this URL: http://www. chem4kids. com/files/react_acidbase. html. \n Question: Reacting with metal is one thing that distinguishes acids from what?"
menstrual cycle,"Support: If a sperm does not enter an egg, the lining of the uterus breaks down. Blood and other tissues from the lining break off from the uterus. They pass through the vagina and out of the body. This is called menstruation . Menstruation is also called a menstrual period. It lasts about 4 days, on average. When the menstrual period ends, the cycle repeats. Some women feel discomfort during this process. \n Question: What cycle occurs in women of reproductive age, as a long as a sperm does not enter an egg?"
therapods,"Support: Birds are thought to have evolved from a group of bipedal dinosaurs called theropods . The ancestor of birds was probably similar to the theropod called Deinonychus, which is represented by the sketch in Figure below . Fossils of Deinonychus were first identified in the 1960s. This was an extremely important discovery. It finally convinced most scientists that birds had descended from dinosaurs, which had been debated for almost a century. \n Question: Birds are thought to have evolved from a group of bipedal dinosaurs called what?"
eruption is close,"Support: Earthquakes may take place every day near a volcano. But before an eruption, the number and size of earthquakes increases. This is the result of magma pushing upward into the magma chamber. This motion causes stresses on neighboring rock to build up. Eventually the ground shakes. A continuous string of earthquakes may indicate that a volcano is about to erupt. Scientists use seismographs to record the length and strength of each earthquake. \n Question: What does a continuous string of earthquakes indicate about a volcano?"
neurons,"Support: Neurons Neurons are the cells considered to be the basis of nervous tissue. They are responsible for the electrical signals that communicate information about sensations, and that produce movements in response to those stimuli, along with inducing thought processes within the brain. An important part of the function of neurons is in their structure, or shape. The threedimensional shape of these cells makes the immense numbers of connections within the nervous system possible. \n Question: What cells are the basis of nervous tissue?"
axis,"Support: Classification Features of Animals Animals are classified according to morphological and developmental characteristics, such as a body plan. With the exception of sponges, the animal body plan is symmetrical. This means that their distribution of body parts is balanced along an axis. Additional characteristics that contribute to animal classification include the number of tissue layers formed during development, the presence or absence of an internal body cavity, and other features of embryological development. \n Question: Animals are classified according to morphological and developmental characteristics, such as a body plan. with the exception of sponges, the animal body plan is symmetrical. this means that their distribution of body parts is balanced along this?"
by dna ligase,"Support: DNA polymerase starts adding nucleotides to the 3'-OH end of the primer. Elongation of both the lagging and the leading strand continues. RNA primers are removed by exonuclease activity. Gaps are filled by DNA pol by adding dNTPs. The gap between the two DNA fragments is sealed by DNA ligase, which helps in the formation of phosphodiester bonds. Table 14.1 summarizes the enzymes involved in prokaryotic DNA replication and the functions of each. \n Question: The gap between two dna fragments is sealed by what?"
dynamic,"Support: One thing to note about equilibrium is that the reactions do not stop; both the forward reaction and the reverse reaction continue to occur. They both occur at the same rate, so any overall change by one reaction is cancelled by the reverse reaction. We say that chemical equilibrium is dynamic, rather than static. Also, because both reactions are occurring simultaneously, the equilibrium can be written backward. For example, representing an equilibrium as. \n Question: Both the forward reaction and the reverse reaction continue to occur, so chemical equilibrium is said to be what, rather than static?"
antioxidants,"Support: Antioxidants are important for the health of a cell. An antioxidant is a molecule that inhibits the oxidation of other molecules. Oxidation is a chemical reaction that transfers electrons or hydrogen from a substance to an oxidizing agent, producing free radicals in the process. These free radicals initiate a chain reaction in the cell that can cause cell damage, or can lead to cell death. Antioxidants prevent these chain reactions from even initiating. \n Question: What do you call health-promoting molecules that inhibit the oxidation of other molecules?"
taxonomy,"Support: Like you, scientists also group together similar organisms. The science of classifying living things is called taxonomy. Scientists classify living things in order to organize and make sense of the incredible diversity of life. Modern scientists base their classifications mainly on molecular similarities. They group together organisms that have similar proteins and DNA. Molecular similarities show that organisms are related. In other words, they are descendants of a common ancestor in the past. \n Question: What is the science of classifying living things called?"
tumor,"Support: Hypersecretion by an endocrine gland is often caused by a tumor. For example, a tumor of the pituitary gland can cause hypersecretion of growth hormone. If this occurs in childhood, it results in very long arms and legs and abnormally tall stature by adulthood. The condition is commonly known as gigantism (see Figure below ). See Giants - Part 1 - Pituitary Gigantism and Acromegaly at http://www. youtube. com/watch?v=Ebhf1qKVA9A for information about pituitary giants. \n Question: Hypersection by an endocrine gland is often caused by what?"
solute and solvent,"Support: All solutions have two parts: the solute and the solvent. The solute is the substance that dissolves, and the solvent is the substance that dissolves the solute. Particles of solvent pull apart particles of solute, and the solute particles spread throughout the solvent. Salt water, such as the ocean water in the Figure below , is an example of a solution. In a saltwater solution, salt is the solute and water is the solvent. \n Question: What are the two components of all solutions?"
isotopes,"Support: The first plants were probably similar to the stoneworts in Figure below . Stoneworts are green algae. Like stoneworts, the first plants were aquatic. They may have had stalks but not stems. They also may have had hair-like structures called rhizoids but not roots. The first plants probably had male and female reproductive organs and needed water to reproduce. In stoneworts, sperm need at least a thin film of moisture to swim to eggs. \n Question: What are atoms of the same element that differ in their numbers of neutrons called?"
cancers,"Support: Many cancers result from uncontrolled cell division, when the regulation of the cycle is lost ( Figure below ). Recall that the cell cycle is the normal life of a cell. During this cycle, the cell performs its necessary functions, replicates its DNA and organelles, and divides through mitosis and cytokinesis, such that two genetically identical cells result. The cycle is highly regulated so that no phase proceeds before it is ready to do so. \n Question: What results from uncontrolled cell division?"
the voltage drop,"Support: Ammeters and voltmeters are cleverly designed for the way they are used. Ammeters measure the current of a circuit, and voltmeters measure the voltage drop across a resistor. It is important in the design and use of these meters that they don't change the circuit in such a way as to influence the readings. While both types of meters are technically resistors, they are specifically designed to make their readings without changing the circuit itself. \n Question: What do voltmeters measure across a resistor?"
spinal cavity,"Support: Figure 33.6 Vertebrate animals have two major body cavities. The dorsal cavity, indicated in green, contains the cranial and the spinal cavity. The ventral cavity, indicated in yellow, contains the thoracic cavity and the abdominopelvic cavity. The thoracic cavity is separated from the abdominopelvic cavity by the diaphragm. The thoracic cavity is separated into the abdominal cavity and the pelvic cavity by an imaginary line parallel to the pelvis bones. (credit: modification of work by NCI). \n Question: Vertebrate animals have two major body cavities, the dorsal and what is the other?"
lumen,"Support: The inside of the small intestine has many folds, called villi. Microvilli are lined with blood vessels as well as lymphatic vessels. The inside of the small intestine is called the lumen. Figure 34.19 Which of the following statements about digestive processes is true? a. Amylase, maltase and lactase in the mouth digest carbohydrates. Trypsin and lipase in the stomach digest protein. Bile emulsifies lipids in the small intestine. No food is absorbed until the small intestine. \n Question: The inside of the small intestine has many folds, called villi. microvilli are lined with blood vessels as well as lymphatic vessels. the inside of the small intestine is called this?"
convex,"Support: The other type of curved mirror, a convex mirror, is shaped like the outside of a bowl. Because of its shape, it can gather and reflect light from a wide area. As you can see in the Figure below , a convex mirror forms only virtual images that are right-side up and smaller than the actual object. You can see how a convex mirror forms an image in the animation at this URL: http://physics. slss. ie/resources/convex%20mirror. swf. \n Question: What type of mirror is shaped like the outside of a bowl?"
oxygen,"Support: Today, most living things use oxygen to make ATP from glucose. However, many living things can also make ATP without oxygen. This is true of some plants and fungi and also of many bacteria. These organisms use aerobic respiration when oxygen is present, but when oxygen is in short supply, they use anaerobic respiration instead. Certain bacteria can only use anaerobic respiration. In fact, they may not be able to survive at all in the presence of oxygen. \n Question: What do most living things use to make atp from glucose?"
core,"Support: After a supernova explosion, the star's core is left over. This material is extremely dense. What happens next depends on the core's mass. The core might be less than about four times the mass of the sun. In this case, the star will become a neutron star. A neutron star ( Figure below ) is made almost entirely of neutrons. A neutron star has more mass than the sun; yet, it is only a few kilometers in diameter. \n Question: After a supernova, what part of a star remains?"
star clusters,"Support: Star clusters are groups of stars smaller than a galaxy. There are two main types, open clusters and globular clusters. Open clusters are groups of up to a few thousand stars held together by gravity. The Jewel Box, shown in Figure below , is an open cluster. Open clusters tend to be blue in color, and often contain glowing gas and dust. The stars in an open cluster are young stars that all formed from the same nebula. \n Question: What are groups of stars called that are smaller than a galaxy?"
disaccharide,"Support: If two monosaccharides bond together, they form a carbohydrate called a disaccharide . Two monosaccharides will bond together through a dehydration reaction, in which a water molecule is lost. A dehydration reaction is a condensation reaction , a chemical reaction in which two molecules combine to form one single molecule, losing a small molecule in the process. In the dehydration reaction, this small molecule is water. The bond between two monosaccharides is known as a glycosidic bond . \n Question: What do we call a carbohydrate formed by two monosaccharides bonding together?"
dead organisms,"Support: Most fungi get organic compounds from dead organisms. They are decomposers called saprotrophs. A saprotroph feeds on any remaining organic matter after other decomposers do their work. Fungi use enzymes to digest organic remains and then absorb the resulting organic compounds. As decomposers, fungi are vital for the health of ecosystems. They break down nonliving organic matter and release the nutrients into the soil. Plants can then use the nutrients and pass them on to herbivores and other consumers. \n Question: Most fungi get organic compounds from what?"
plants,"Support: People remove a lot of vegetation. They log forests or prepare the land for farming or construction. Even just walking or riding your bike over the same place can kill the grass. But plants help to hold the soil in place ( Figure below ). Without plants to protect it, soil may be carried away by wind or running water. In many areas, soil is eroding faster than it is forming. In these locations, soil is a non-renewable resource. \n Question: What kind of organisms helps hold soil in place to slow erosion?"
kinetic energy,"Support: How Nonconservative Forces Affect Mechanical Energy Mechanical energy may not be conserved when nonconservative forces act. For example, when a car is brought to a stop by friction on level ground, it loses kinetic energy, which is dissipated as thermal energy, reducing its mechanical energy. Figure 7.15 compares the effects of conservative and nonconservative forces. We often choose to understand simpler systems such as that described in Figure 7.15(a) first before studying more complicated systems as in Figure 7.15(b). \n Question: When a car is brought to a stop by friction on level ground, it loses what?"
helicase,"Support: DNA replication. The two DNA strands are opened by helicase. The strands are held open by a single strand of binding proteins, preventing premature reannealing. Topoisomerase solves the problem caused by tension generated by winding/unwinding of DNA. This enzyme wraps around DNA and makes a cut permitting the helix to spin and relax. Once DNA is relaxed, topoisomerase reconnects broken strands. DNA primase synthesizes a short RNA primer which initiates the Okazaki fragment. Okazaki fragments are attached by DNA ligase. \n Question: What opens two strands of dna?"
polymer,"Support: Starches are complex carbohydrates. They are polymers of glucose. A polymer is a large molecule that consists of many smaller, repeating molecules, called monomers. The monomers are joined together by covalent bonds. Starches contain hundreds of glucose monomers. Plants make starches to store extra glucose. Consumers get starches by eating plants. Common sources of starches in the human diet are pictured in the Figure below . Our digestive system breaks down starches to sugar, which our cells use for energy. \n Question: What is a large molecule with many repeating units?"
cardiac muscle,"Support: To move blood through the heart, the cardiac muscle needs to contract in an organized way. Blood first enters the atria ( Figure below ). When the atria contract, blood is pushed into the ventricles. After the ventricles fill with blood, they contract, and blood is pushed out of the heart. The heart is mainly composed of cardiac muscle. These muscle cells contract in unison, causing the heart itself to contract and generating enough force to push the blood out. \n Question: What kind of muscle is the heart mainly composed of?"
quantum numbers,"Support: The n = 1 shell is completely filled in a helium atom. The next atom is the alkali metal lithium with an atomic number of 3. The first two electrons in lithium fill the 1s orbital and have the same sets of four quantum numbers as the two electrons in helium. The remaining electron must occupy the orbital of next lowest energy, the 2s orbital (Figure 6.27 or Figure 6.28). Thus, the electron configuration and orbital diagram of lithium are:. \n Question: The first two electrons in lithium fill the 1s orbital and have the same sets of four what as the two electrons in helium?"
torque,"Support: Torque is equal to the cross product as stated above. In general, one can simplify by saying that the torque is equal to the force acting on the object multiplied by the perpendicular distance from the application of the force to the rotational axis. Say you had a seesaw. It is easier to exert torque, get the seesaw to move, if you pushed on the board near the end rather than near the middle. It is the rotational version of Force. \n Question: In phyisics, what is considered to be the rotational version of force?"
elephantiasis,"Support: Roundworms can be free-living organisms, but they are probably best known for their role as significant plant and animal parasites. Most Nematodes are parasitic, with over 16,000 parasitic species described. Heartworms, which cause serious disease in dogs while living in the heart and blood vessels, are a type of roundworm. Roundworms can also cause disease in humans. Elephantiasis, a disease characterized by the extreme swelling of the limbs ( Figure below ), is caused by infection with a type of roundworm. \n Question: What disease characterized by the extreme swelling of the limbs is caused by infection with a type of roundworm?"
biodiversity,"Support: Biodiversity refers to the variety of life and its processes, including the variety of living organisms, the genetic differences among them, and the communities and ecosystems in which they occur. Scientists have identified about 1.9 million species alive today. They are divided into the six kingdoms of life shown in Figure below . Scientists are still discovering new species. Thus, they do not know for sure how many species really exist today. Most estimates range from 5 to 30 million species. \n Question: What term is used to describe  the variety of life and its processes, including the variety of living organisms, the genetic differences among them, and the communities and ecosystems in which they occur?"
gastro-esophageal sphincter,"Support: A ring-like muscle called a sphincter forms valves in the digestive system. The gastro-esophageal sphincter is located at the stomach end of the esophagus. In response to swallowing and the pressure exerted by the bolus of food, this sphincter opens, and the bolus enters the stomach. When there is no swallowing action, this sphincter is shut and prevents the contents of the stomach from traveling up the esophagus. Many animals have a true sphincter; however, in humans, there is no true. \n Question: Which sphincter is located at the stomach end of the esophagus and opens to allow the bolus to enter the stomach?"
golden eagles,"Support: Although not as famous as its bald cousin, Golden Eagles are much easier to find in Northern California - one of the largest breeding populations for Golden Eagles. The largest of the raptors, Golden Eagles weigh typically between 8 and 12 pounds, and their wing span is around 6 to 7 feet. These eagles dive towards earth to catch prey, and can reach speeds of up to 200 mph! Meet one of the largest birds of prey at http://www. kqed. org/quest/television/cool-critters-the-golden-eagle . \n Question: What living species of bird is considered the  largest of the raptors?"
electroluminescence,"Support: A vapor light produces visible light by electroluminescence. The bulb contains a small amount of solid sodium or mercury as well as a mixture of neon and argon gases. When an electric current passes through the gases, it causes the solid sodium or mercury to change to a gas and emit visible light. Sodium vapor lights, like these streetlights, produce yellowish light. Mercury vapor lights produce bluish light. Vapor lights are very bright and energy efficient. The bulbs are also long lasting. \n Question: A vapor light produces visible light by what process?"
exocytosis,"Support: Exocytosis describes the process of vesicles fusing with the plasma membrane and releasing their contents to the outside of the cell, as shown in Figure below . Exocytosis occurs when a cell produces substances for export, such as a protein, or when the cell is getting rid of a waste product or a toxin. Newly made membrane proteins and membrane lipids are moved on top the plasma membrane by exocytosis. For a detailed animation of cellular secretion, see http://vcell. ndsu. edu/animations/constitutivesecretion/first. htm . \n Question: What term describes the process of vesicles fusing with the plasma membrane and releasing their contents to the outside of the cell?"
amphibians,"Support: What group of animals begins its life in the water, but then spends most of its life on land? Amphibians! Amphibians are a group of vertebrates that has adapted to live in both water and on land. Amphibian larvae are born and live in water, and they breathe using gills. The adults live on land for part of the time and breathe both through their skin and with their lungs as their lungs are not sufficient to provide the necessary amount of oxygen. \n Question: What group of animals has adapted to live in both water and on land?"
cell membrane,"Support: This window screen has a fly on it. In a way, the window screen is like a cell membrane. It lets some things pass through while keeping other things out. Air molecules and raindrops can pass through the screen, but larger objects like the fly cannot. In the first lesson of this chapter, you'll learn about different ways that substances can pass through the cell membrane. You'll find out how the cell membrane lets some substances pass through while keeping other substances out. \n Question: What allows some things to enter the cell while keeping other things out?"
plant,"Support: All but one of the structures described above are found in plant cells as well as animal cells. The only exception is centrioles, which are not found in plant cells. Plant cells have three additional structures that are not found in animals cells. These include a cell wall, large central vacuole, and organelles called plastids. You can see these structures in the model of a plant cell in Figure below . You can also see them in the interactive plant cell at this link:. \n Question: Presence of a cell wall, large central vacuole, and organelles called plastids distinguish what type of cell?"
domains,"Support: Modern taxonomists have reordered many groups of organisms since Linnaeus. The main categories that biologists use are listed here from the most specific to the least specific category ( Figure below ). All organisms can be classified into one of three domains , the least specific grouping. The three domains are Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. The Kingdom is the next category after the Domain. All life is divided among six kingdoms: Kingdom Bacteria, Kingdom Archaea, Kingdom Protista, Kingdom Plantae, Kingdom Fungi, and Kingdom Animalia. \n Question: All organisms can be classified into one of three of this least specific grouping?"
arthropods,"Support: Many arthropods have extremely important roles in ecosystems. Arthropods are of ecological importance because of their sheer numbers and extreme diversity. As mentioned above, bees, wasps, ants, butterflies, moths, flies and beetles are invaluable agents of pollination. Pollens and grains became accidentally attached to their chests and legs and are transferred to other agricultural crops as these animals move about, either by walking or flying. Most plants actually produce scents to send signals to insects that food (in the form of nectar) is available. \n Question: Bees, wasps, ants, butterflies, moths, flies and beetles belong to what animal phylum?"
hearing,"Support: consists of a microphone that picks up sound. A speech processor selects sounds in the range of human speech, and a transmitter converts these sounds to electrical impulses, which are then sent to the auditory nerve. Which of the following types of hearing loss would not be restored by a cochlear implant? a. Hearing loss resulting from absence or loss of hair cells in the organ of Corti. Hearing loss resulting from an abnormal auditory nerve. Hearing loss resulting from fracture of the cochlea. \n Question: A cochlear implant aims to restore loss of what sense?"
collide,"Support: Most chemical reactions within organisms would be impossible under the normal conditions within cell. For example, the body temperature of most organisms is too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to carry out life processes. Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and collide. Therefore, the rate of most biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions. In organisms, catalysts are called enzymes . \n Question: Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and do what?"
a neutron,"Support: The example above illustrates the basic nuclear fission process. A neutron (generally produced by some controlled process, not usually a natural event) collides with an atom of U-235. Momentarily, a U-236 atom forms which then splits into two smaller atoms (Kr-93 and Ba-141) in the diagram. This process results in the release of three new neutrons, which can then initiate fission reactions with more atoms. We will see later how this propagation of neutrons can be employed in a reactor for the generation of electricity. \n Question: What type of particle collides with an atom of u-235 during the basic nuclear fission process?"
deuterium,"Support: Hydrogen is an example of an element that has isotopes. Three isotopes of hydrogen are modeled in the Figure below . Most hydrogen atoms have just one proton and one electron and lack a neutron. These atoms are just called hydrogen. Some hydrogen atoms have one neutron as well. These atoms are the isotope named deuterium. Other hydrogen atoms have two neutrons. These atoms are the isotope named tritium. For animated versions of these hydrogen isotopes, go to this URL: http://www. s-cool. co. uk/a-level/physics/atomic-structure/revise-it/isotopes . \n Question: A hydrogen atom with one neutron is called what?"
ocean acidification,"Support: Ocean acidification occurs when excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the oceans to become acidic. Burning fossil fuels has led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This carbon dioxide is then absorbed by the oceans, which lowers the pH of the water. Ocean acidification can kill corals and shellfish. It may also cause marine organisms to reproduce less, which could harm other organisms in the food chain. As a result, there also may be fewer marine organisms for humans to consume. \n Question: What occurs when excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the oceans to become acidic?"
incubation,"Support: After birds lay their eggs, they generally keep the eggs warm with their body heat while the embryos inside continue to develop. This is called incubation, or brooding . In most species, parents stay together for at least the length of the breeding season. In some species, they stay together for life. By staying together, the males as well as females can incubate the eggs and later care for the hatchlings . Birds are the only nonhuman vertebrates with this level of male parental involvement. \n Question: What is it called when birds keep their eggs warm while the embryos inside develop?"
mutagens,"Support: mutation. The chemical and/or physical agents that cause mutations are called mutagens. Diseases that occur due to mutations in critical DNA sequences are referred to as genetic diseases. Viruses are infectious agents composed of a tightly packed central core of nucleic acids enclosed by a protective shell of proteins. Viruses contain either DNA or RNA as their genetic material but not both. Some RNA viruses, calledretroviruses, synthesize DNA in the host cell from their RNA genome. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). \n Question: The chemical and/or physical agents that cause mutations are called what?"
solids,"Support: Solids are materials that have both a defined shape and a defined volume. They do not take on the shape of their container, as liquids and gases do. Solids can be either amorphous or crystalline. Amorphous solids (such as glass) do not have a well organized three-dimensional arrangement of molecules or atoms, so they lack a high level of order. On the other hand, crystalline solids display a highly ordered and predictable three-dimensional structure. In this section we will discuss the different types of crystalline solids. \n Question: What is the term for materials that have both a defined shape and a defined volume?"
become red supergiants,"Support: A more massive star ends its life in a more dramatic way. Very massive stars become red supergiants . Unlike a red giant, when all the helium in a red supergiant is gone, fusion continues. Lighter atoms fuse into heavier atoms up to iron atoms. Creating elements heavier than iron through fusion uses more energy than it produces. For this reason, stars do not ordinarily form any heavier elements. When there are no more elements for the star to fuse, the core succumbs to gravity and collapses. \n Question: How do very massive stars end their lives?"
extreme water pressure,"Support: Organisms that live deep in the ocean must be able to withstand extreme water pressure, very cold water, and complete darkness. However, even here, thriving communities of living things can be found. Organisms cluster around hydrothermal vents in the ocean floor. The vents release hot water containing chemicals that would be toxic to most other living things. The producers among them are single-celled chemoautotrophs. They make food using energy stored in the chemicals. The tube worms in this chapter's opening photo depend on these chemoautotrophs for food. \n Question: Organisms that live deep in the ocean must be able to withstand what?"
food,"Support: There are many other examples of innate behaviors. For example, did you know that honeybees dance? The honeybee pictured below has found a source of food ( Figure below ). When the bee returns to its hive, it will do a dance. This dance is called the waggle dance . The way the bee moves during its dance tells other bees in the hive where to find the food. Honeybees can do the waggle dance without learning it from other bees, so it is an innate behavior. \n Question: A bee will sometimes do a dance to tell other bees in the hive where to find what?"
minerals they contain,"Support: Igneous rocks are grouped by the size of their crystals and the minerals they contain. The minerals in igneous rocks are grouped into families. Some contain mostly lighter colored minerals, some have a combination of light and dark minerals, and some have mostly darker minerals. The combination of minerals is determined by the composition of the magma. Magmas that produce lighter colored minerals are higher in silica. These create rocks such as granite and rhyolite. Darker colored minerals are found in rocks such as gabbro and basalt. \n Question: Besides the size of their crystals, how are igneous rocks grouped?"
exothermic,"Support: Thermodynamic spontaneity. The highly exothermic and dramatic thermite reaction is thermodynamically spontaneous. Reactants of aluminum and a metal oxide, usually iron, which are stable at room temperature, are ignited either in the presence of heat or by the reaction of potassium permanganate and glycerin. The resulting products are aluminum oxide, free and molten elemental metal, and a great deal of heat, which makes this an excellent method for on-site welding. Because this reaction has its own oxygen supply, it can be used for underwater welding as well. \n Question: A thermite reaction is thermodynamically spontaneous, and because it is associated with a significant release of heat, it is regarded as what?"
energy,"Support: The number of molecular orbitals produced is the same as the number of atomic orbitals used to create them (the law of conservation of orbitals). As the overlap between two atomic orbitals increases, the difference in energy between the resulting bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals increases. When two atomic orbitals combine to form a pair of molecular orbitals, the bonding molecular orbital is stabilized about as much as the antibonding molecular orbital is destabilized. The interaction between atomic orbitals is greatest when they have the same energy. \n Question: The interaction between atomic orbitals is greatest when they have the same what?"
solvent,"Support: Dilution is also a common means of preparing solutions of a desired concentration. By adding solvent to a measured portion of a more concentrated stock solution, we can achieve a particular concentration. For example, commercial pesticides are typically sold as solutions in which the active ingredients are far more concentrated than is appropriate for their application. Before they can be used on crops, the pesticides must be diluted. This is also a very common practice for the preparation of a number of common laboratory reagents (Figure 3.17). \n Question: What is added to a measured portion of a more concentrated stock solution to achieve a particular concentration?"
hydrogen bond,"Support: Opposites attract when it comes to charged molecules. In the case of water, the positive (hydrogen) end of one water molecule is attracted to the negative (oxygen) end of a nearby water molecule. Because of this attraction, weak bonds form between adjacent water molecules, as shown in Figure below . The type of bond that forms between molecules is called a hydrogen bond . Bonds between molecules are not as strong as bonds within molecules, but in water they are strong enough to hold together nearby molecules. \n Question: The type of bond that forms between molecules is called what?"
expansion joints,"Support: Forces and pressures created by thermal stress are typically as great as that in the example above. Railroad tracks and roadways can buckle on hot days if they lack sufficient expansion joints. (See Figure 13.14. ) Power lines sag more in the summer than in the winter, and will snap in cold weather if there is insufficient slack. Cracks open and close in plaster walls as a house warms and cools. Glass cooking pans will crack if cooled rapidly or unevenly, because of differential contraction and the. \n Question: Railroad tracks and roadways can buckle on hot days if they lack sufficient what?"
physical oceanography,"Support: There are many branches of oceanography. Physical oceanography is the study of water movement, like waves and ocean currents. Physical oceanographers ask when or if a tsunami will hit a shoreline. Marine geologists look at rocks and structures in the ocean basins. These scientists ask how new ocean crust forms. Chemical oceanographers study the natural elements in ocean water. Chemical oceanographers might be concerned with where carbon dioxide goes in the oceans. Marine biologists look at marine life. There are lots of questions to ask about marine life!. \n Question: What is the study of water movement, including waves and ocean currents?"
wavelength,Support: Another important measure of wave size is wavelength. Wavelength is the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves (see Figure above ). Wavelength can be measured as the distance between two adjacent crests of a transverse wave or two adjacent compressions of a longitudinal wave. It is usually measured in meters. Wavelength is related to the energy of a wave. Short-wavelength waves have more energy than long-wavelength waves of the same amplitude. You can see examples of waves with shorter and longer wavelengths in Figure below . \n Question: What term describes the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves?
oxidants,"Support: Oxidants and Reductants Compounds that are capable of accepting electrons, such as O 2 or F2, are calledoxidants (or oxidizing agents) because they can oxidize other compounds. In the process of accepting electrons, an oxidant is reduced. Compounds that are capable of donating electrons, such as sodium metal or cyclohexane (C6H12), are calledreductants (or reducing agents) because they can cause the reduction of another compound. In the process of donating electrons, a reductant is oxidized. These relationships are summarized in Equation 3.30: Equation 3.30 Saylor URL: http://www. saylor. org/books. \n Question: Compounds that are capable of accepting electrons, such as o 2 or f2, are called what?"
warm air mass,"Support: A cold front forms when a cold air mass runs into a warm air mass ( Figure below ). The cold air mass moves faster than the warm air mass. So the cold air mass lifts the warm air mass out of its way. As the warm air rises, its water vapor condenses. Clouds form, and precipitation falls. If the warm air is very humid, precipitation can be heavy. Temperature and pressure differences between the two air masses cause winds. Winds may be very strong along a cold front. \n Question: A cold front is formed when a cold air mass runs into what?"
felsic magmas,"Support: The chemistry of a magma determines the type of igneous rock it forms. The chemistry also determines how the magma moves. The higher the amount of silica in the magma, the higher the viscosity. Viscosity is a liquid's resistance to flow. Viscous magmas tend to stay below the surface or erupt explosively. These are felsic magmas, which are high in silica. When magma is fluid and runny, it is not viscous. This magma often reaches the surface by flowing out in rivers of lava. These are low-silica mafic magmas. \n Question: What is the term for viscous magmas that are high in silica and tend to stay below the surface or erupt explosively?"
allopolyploids,"Support: The cultivated forms of wheat, cotton, and tobacco plants are all allopolyploids. Although polyploidy occurs occasionally in animals, it takes place most commonly in plants. (Animals with any of the types of chromosomal aberrations described here are unlikely to survive and produce normal offspring. ) Scientists have discovered more than half of all plant species studied relate back to a species evolved through polyploidy. With such a high rate of polyploidy in plants, some scientists hypothesize that this mechanism takes place more as an adaptation than as an error. \n Question: The cultivated forms of wheat, cotton, and tobacco plants are all what?"
biology,"Support: The study of biology is the study of life. Concept Biology Advanced is the CK-12 Foundation's most extensive material describing the study of life. Concept Biology Advanced presents biology as a set of 18 concepts, with each concept centered around a specific category, such as cell biology or plants. Each concept is comprised of a series of lessons, with each lesson focusing on one specific topic. The complete Concept Biology Advanced is comprised of over 550 lessons. This material has been developed to complement the most advanced secondary-level biology course. \n Question: What is the official name for the study of life?"
natural,"Support: The fibers that compose the materials for our clothes are either natural or human-made. Silk and cotton would be examples of natural fibers. Silk is produced by the silkworm and cotton is grown as a plant. Human-made fabrics include nylon, orlon, and a number of other polymers. These materials are made from hydrocarbons found in petroleum products. Synthetic polymers are also used in shoes, raingear, and camping items. The synthetic fabrics tend to be lighter than the natural ones and can be treated to make them more water-resistant and durable. \n Question: Silk and cotton are examples of what kind of fiber?"
ribosomes,"Support: The nucleus of many cells also contains an organelle called a nucleolus , shown in Figure below . The nucleolus is mainly involved in the assembly of ribosomes. Ribosomes are organelles made of protein and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and they build cellular proteins in the cytoplasm. The function of the rRNA is to provide a way of decoding the genetic messages within another type of RNA, called mRNA for messenger RNA, into amino acids. After being made in the nucleolus, ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm where they direct protein synthesis. \n Question: Which organelles, made of protein and ribosomal rna, build cellular proteins in the cytoplasm?"
epiphytes,"Support: Plants called epiphytes grow on other plants. They obtain moisture from the air instead of the soil. Most epiphytes are ferns or orchids that live in rainforests. Host trees provide support for the plants. They allow epiphytes to get air and sunlight high above the forest floor. This lets the plants get out of the shadows on the forest floor so they can get enough light for photosynthesis. Being elevated may also reduce the risk of being eaten by herbivores. In addition, it may increase the chances of pollination by wind. \n Question: What are plants that grow on other plants called?"
aquarius,"Support: The Helix nebula, located about 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius, belongs to a class of objects called planetary nebulae . Planetary nebulae are the remains of stars that once looked a lot like our sun. When sun-like stars die, they puff out their outer gaseous layers. These layers are heated by the hot core of the dead star, called a white dwarf, and shine with infrared and visible colors. Scientists can study the birth and death of stars by analyzing the types of light that are emitted from nebulae. \n Question: In which constellation is the helix nebula located?"
aluminum,"Support: Metals represent approximately 25% of the elemental makeup of the Earth's crust. The bulk of these metals, primarily aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium, are typically found in combined form. The most abundant metal is aluminum, which occurs almost exclusively as the ionic mineral bauxite. The other most common metals, including iron, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium, are also found primarily as the cationic portion of an ionic compound. Very few metals actually occur naturally as pure substances. The ones that do are often referred to as precious or semi-precious metals. \n Question: What is the most abundant metal of the earth's crust?"
lower limb,"Support: Appendicular System: Congenital Clubfoot Clubfoot, also known as talipes, is a congenital (present at birth) disorder of unknown cause and is the most common deformity of the lower limb. It affects the foot and ankle, causing the foot to be twisted inward at a sharp angle, like the head of a golf club (Figure 8.21). Clubfoot has a frequency of about 1 out of every 1,000 births, and is twice as likely to occur in a male child as in a female child. In 50 percent of cases, both feet are affected. \n Question: Clubfoot, also known as talipes, is a congenital (present at birth) disorder of unknown cause and is the most common deformity of what?"
electrons,"Support: In the course of this reaction, electrons are shifted away from each hydrogen atom and towards the oxygen atom. The hydrogen is oxidized because it undergoes a partial loss of electrons. Even though the loss is not complete enough to form ions, the hydrogen atoms in water have less electron density near them than they did in the H 2 molecule. The oxygen is reduced because it undergoes a partial gain of electrons. The oxygen atom in water has greater electron density near it than they did in the O 2 molecule. \n Question: The hydrogen is oxidized because it undergoes a partial loss of what?"
insects,"Support: This Monarch caterpillar is an invertebrate. It is also an insect and an arthropod. Of all the animal species, it is estimated that well over 90% are invertebrates. Of all invertebrates, the insects are by far the most numerous. There are so many species of insects that scientists have yet to discover them all, let alone name or count them. Estimates of the total number of insect species fall in the range of 1 to 30 million. So, it helps if there are methods to classify not just the insects, but all invertebrates. \n Question: What are by far the most common type of invertebrate?"
specific heat,"Support: When heat flows into an object, its thermal energy increases and so does its temperature. The amount of temperature increase depends on three things: 1) how much heat was added, 2) the size of the object, and 3) the material of which the object is made. When you add the same amount of heat to the same mass of different substances, the amount of temperature increase is different. Each substance has a specific heat, which is the amount of heat necessary to raise one mass unit of that substance by one temperature unit. \n Question: The amount of heat required to raise a single mass unit of a substance by a single temperature unit is known as what?"
solvation,"Support: After coming apart from the crystal, the individual ions are then surrounded by solvent particles in a process called solvation . Note that the individual Na + ions are surrounded by water molecules with the oxygen atom oriented near the positive ion. Likewise, the chloride ions are surrounded by water molecules with the opposite orientation. Hydration is the process of solute particles being surrounded by water molecules arranged in a specific manner. Hydration helps to stabilize aqueous solutions by preventing the positive and negative ions from coming back together and forming a precipitate. \n Question: After coming apart from the crystal, the individual ions are then surrounded by solvent particles in a process called what?"
sexual reproduction,"Support: Most insects can reproduce very quickly within a short period of time. With a short generation time, they evolve faster and can quickly adjust to environmental changes. Most insects reproduce by sexual reproduction . The female produces eggs, which are fertilized by the male, and then the eggs are usually placed near the required food. In some insects, there is asexual reproduction during which the offspring come from a single parent. In this type of reproduction, the offspring are almost identical to the mother. This is most often seen in aphids and scale insects. \n Question: Most insects reproduce quickly and through what type of reproduction?"
amphibians,"Support: Amphibians are the first true tetrapods , or vertebrates with four limbs. Amphibians have less variation in size than fish, ranging in length from 1 centimeter (2.5 inches) to 1.5 meters (about 5 feet). They generally have moist skin without scales. Their skin contains keratin , a tough, fibrous protein found in the skin, scales, feathers, hair, and nails of tetrapod vertebrates, from amphibians to humans. Some forms of keratin are tougher than others. The form in amphibian skin is not very tough, and it allows gases and water to pass through their skin. \n Question: What broad group of animals are the first true tetrapods, vertebrates with four limbs?"
liquid and solid states,"Support: A lipid is a member of a class of water-insoluble compounds that includes oils, fats, and waxes. Oils and fats are based on the same general structure, but fats are solids at room temperature, while oils are liquids. Butter is an example of a fat and is derived from animals. Some oils include olive oil and canola oil, which are obtained from plants. Lipids are an essential part of a healthy diet, though excess dietary fat can be harmful. Lipids store energy in the body and are also needed to keep cell membranes healthy. \n Question: What is the difference between oils and fats at room temperature?"
cell,"Support: All forms of life are built of at least one cell. A cell is the basic unit of the structure and function of living things. Living things may appear very different from one another on the outside, but their cells are very similar. Compare the human cells on the left in Figure below and onion cells on the right in Figure below . How are they similar? If you click on the animation titled Inside a Cell at the link below, you can look inside a cell and see its internal structures. http://bio-alive. com/animations/cell-biology. htm. \n Question: What is the basic unit of the structure and function of living things?"
cells,"Support: If you zoom in very close on a leaf of a plant, or on the skin on your hand, or a drop of blood, you will find cells, you will find cells ( Figure below ). Cells are the smallest structural and functional unit of all living organisms. Most cells are so small that they are usually visible only through a microscope. Some organisms, like bacteria, plankton that live in the ocean, or the Paramecium, shown in Figure below , are unicellular, made of just one cell. Other organisms have millions, billions, or trillions of cells. \n Question: What are the smallest structural and functional unit of all living organisms?"
pollinate,"Support: Mammals also interact with other species in many symbiotic relationships. For example, bats have established mutually beneficial relationships with plants. Nectar-feeding bats receive a tasty treat from each flower, and, in return, they pollinate the flowers. That means they transfer pollen from one flower to another, allowing the plant to reproduce. Non-flying mammalian pollinators include marsupials, primates, and rodents. In most cases, these animals visit flowers to eat their nectar, and end up with pollen stuck to their bodies. When the animal visits another flower to eat the nectar, the pollen is transferred to that flower. \n Question: What do nectar-feeding bats do to flowers?"
abrasion,"Support: Abrasion is another type of mechanical weathering. With abrasion, one rock bumps against another rock. Gravity causes abrasion as a rock tumbles down a slope. Moving water causes abrasion; it moves rocks so that they bump against one another ( Figure below ). Strong winds cause abrasion by blasting sand against rock surfaces. Finally, the ice in glaciers cause abrasion. Pieces of rock embedded in ice at the bottom of a glacier scrape against the rock below. If you have ever collected beach glass or pebbles from a stream, you have witnessed the work of abrasion. \n Question: What type of mechanical weathering occurs when one rock bumps against another rock?"
distance,"Support: The distance between the Earth and the Sun is about 150 million kilometers. Earth revolves around the Sun at an average speed of about 27 kilometers (17 miles) per second. Mercury and Venus are closer to the Sun, so they take shorter times to make one orbit. Mercury takes only about 88 Earth days to make one trip around the Sun. All of the other planets take longer amounts of time. The exact amount depends on the planet's distance from the Sun. Saturn takes more than 29 Earth years to make one revolution around the Sun. \n Question: What determines how long a planet's orbit is around the sun?"
sperm and egg,"Support: The life cycle of a plant is very different from the life cycle of an animal. Humans are made entirely of diploid cells (cells with two sets of chromosomes, referred to as ''2n''). Our only cells that are haploid cells (cells with one set of chromosomes, ''n'') are sperm and egg cells. Plants, however, can live when they are are at the stage of having haploid cells or diploid cells. If a plant has a haploid chromosome number of 20, what is the diploid chromosome number? If the diploid chromosome number is 20, what is the haploid number?. \n Question: In humans, the only haploid cells are what reproductive cells?"
inclined plane,"Support: Look at the ramp in the Figure below . A ramp is a type of simple machine called an inclined plane. It can be used to raise an object off the ground. The input distance is the length of the sloped surface of the ramp. This is the distance over which the input force is applied. The output distance is the height of the ramp, or the vertical distance the object is raised. For this ramp, the input distance is 6 m and the output distance is 2 meters. Therefore, the ideal mechanical advantage of this ramp is:. \n Question: A ramp is a type of simple machine called what?"
solvent,"Support: A solution forms when one substance dissolves in another. The substance that dissolves is called the solute . The substance it dissolves in is called the solvent . For example, ocean water is a solution in which the solute is salt and the solvent is water. In this example, a solid (salt) is dissolved in a liquid (water). However, matter in any state can be the solute or solvent in a solution. Solutions may be gases, liquids, or solids. In Table below and the video at the URL below, you can learn about solutions involving other states of matter. \n Question: In a solution what is the substance a solute dissolves in is called?"
